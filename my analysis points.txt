My Accomplishments

- I've been engaged in development of 2 new features Private Note and Bulk SMS 
- I've assisted the null-safe migration of flutter code base
- I've also assist in development of ezconnect support for mobile platform 
- I've tried to improve the code quality interactively and incidently

My Struggles :

- I found bit challenging to cope up with the flutter web as I was not having the 
  web experience in the past

- The initial code setup was bit 


Area of Improvements
- I've actually kind of tendency that when I get involved with something may be invested
  POC, actual feature or bug, until I get 100% clarity I am unfocused to other parallel stuffs
  I carry this impulse from a long back, but I've improved myself on this and will continue to 
  work for the same to keep optimal balance

- Due to several health consequences since last 2 month, I've observed that my daily 
  timeline (ie check-in and check-out) was uneven. But I'll try to ameliorate it to usual.

- Technically, I need to gain more skills for handling the cross-platform app from multiple perspectives
  such as code architecture, code maintainability, code readability, code integrations and likewise
  

My Shortcomings

- I do interact with colleagues for technical or task oriented discussion more often
  However the interaction regarding other awareness or non-tech stuff is less is what I feel.
  So I'll try to be more extrovert than what I am at present

- I do need to improve with my cross-platform development skills
  For instance as from earlier time I was well versed with mobile development (esp android)
      but now since I am functioning with multiple platforms so I need to gain know-how respectively
      i.e Ios, Web, Desktop 

I struggle with last-minute deviations from the plan. 
I like to be very well-prepared, so when things change I often struggle to remain composed as I rework my role in the project. Iâ€™d like to work on this by taking a ToastMasters course. I think the on-the-spot nature of public speaking, 
which the group teaches, will help me become more confident with unexpected changes.
