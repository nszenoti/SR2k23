* Impact you want to deliver in next review period 

  I want to bring more proficient solutions with my contributions.
  For example By improving the code quality so as to make code more readable and maintainable.
  In addition to that, Code restructuring or refactoring may bring more robustness and thus serve above purpose likewise.

  I aim to strengthen my problem solving competency so that I can frame optimal approaches for different perspective of product development.

  Secondly, I need to be bit more versatile in my role So that I can improve my decision making capability
  and contribute comfortably in the different phase and domain of the decided goals.
  If given an opportunity I would like to indulge in the AI/ML domain and associated usecases, eventually contributing towards the associated product development goals. 

  I will also put my efforts to improve the communication skills as sometimes I struggle to share my ideas or concerns clearly.
  
  I have given a consideration to the areas where I can improve and have come up with several ideas/strategies

  In the future, I will focus on becoming more organized and disciplined, to ensure all requirements are taken care of.
  I actually carry kind of tendency that when I get engrossed with some task, and if I stuck at some doubt then until I resolve it, I cannot equally focus to other stuffs
  I carry this impulse from a long back, but I've improved myself on this and will continue to work on it so that I can adapt to other requirements much faster.
  Sometimes, I lack the motivation to continue putting in my best work. However, I plan to combat that by keeping track of my long-term goals and setting short-term goals, to help me stay on track.

  I am very keen to develop my leadership as well as technical skills further as I know it will help me take my performance to the next level.

  I have a long-term vision for my career and continually take steps toward achieving it.
