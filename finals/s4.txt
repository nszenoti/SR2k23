I want to bring more proficient solutions to my contributions.
For example, by improving the code quality so as to make it more readable and maintainable. In addition to that, code restructuring or refactoring may bring more robustness and thus serve the same purpose.

I aim to strengthen my problem solving competency so that I can frame optimal approaches for different perspectives on product development.

Secondly, I need to be a bit more versatile in my role so that I can improve my decision-making capability and contribute comfortably to the different phases and domains of the decided goals.
If given an opportunity, I would like to indulge in the AI/ML domain and associated usecases, eventually contributing towards the associated product development goals.Â 

I will also put forth my efforts to improve my communication skills, as sometimes I struggle to share my ideas or concerns clearly.

I have given consideration to the areas where I can improve and have come up with several ideas.

In the future, I will focus on becoming more organised and disciplined to ensure all requirements are taken care of.
I actually have the tendency to become engrossed in a task, and if I get stuck on a doubt, I can't focus on anything else until I resolve it. I've carried this impulse for a long time, but I've improved myself on it and will continue to work on it so that I can adapt to other requirements much faster.
Sometimes, I lack the motivation to continue putting in my best work. However, I plan to combat that by keeping track of my long-term goals and setting short-term goals to help me stay on track.

I am very keen to develop my leadership as well as technical skills further, as I know it will help me take my performance to the next level.

I have a long-term vision for my career and continually take steps toward achieving it.
