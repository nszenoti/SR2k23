I've consistently shown commitment and motivation ever since I joined the organization. This helps me demonstrate substantial work values.

I meet set deadlines and objectives most of the time. 
I manage my time effectively by prioritising the important tasks.
I often go above and beyond to match targets and expectations.

I'm extremely proud of my contributions and what I've achieved over the past year.
To point out, I was involved in the development of new ezConnect features, namely "Private Notes" and "Bulk SMS".
I've also helped with Flutter code migration and ezConnect mobile support development.
Aside from that, I've helped with code enhancements and bug fixes for ongoing sprints. 

I conceive that my skills and ability to work in a team have been valuable during this period. 
There are several attributes that I'd like to put forward.

One of the attributes I'd like to highlight is the problem-solving ability, through which I discern the task thoroughly and then devise an approach for a solution likewise. In that case, I can get better context and manage different scenarios efficiently.
By being proactive, I always ask questions related to the stuff I don't understand, which helps me get clarity and be mindful of the requirements. Thus, I can attempt the corresponding task effectively and remain intact to my goals.

I also try to anticipate potential challenges in advance, based on which new ideas and alternative solutions can be figured out if needed. That way, I can stay productive and avoid delays in the process.
While devising the approach, I try to put myself in the customer's shoes to get the end-user perspective. 

I often try to go the extra mile to ensure good code quality.

I have taken an active role in my tasks, working diligently and expressing my ideas and opinions clearly with the team.
Moreover, I consider other's perspectives and guide them if needed.

I like to experiment and explore different ways of addressing a problem based on the requirements.
I seek to learn new things as there is always room to improve and more skills to learn. 

Thus, being responsible and reliable towards my work has helped me to create an impact, and I seek to amplify the same in the future.
